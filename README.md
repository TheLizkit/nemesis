NEMESIS.exe is a trojan horse with 12 payloads in total. Each payload is unique and becomes more and more destructive the more you progress.

This malware took me 3 days to program.

When the malware is executed, it immediately starts to corrupt system files, making them damaged and unusable for further use. This makes the computer unusable. It also replaces the master boot record, so when you boot up the computer, you will be greeted with an amusing rainbow pattern.

Thanks again for trying this malware ;)

I aim on created more unique and better malwares in the future, and to the skidders, please don't skid my stuff..
